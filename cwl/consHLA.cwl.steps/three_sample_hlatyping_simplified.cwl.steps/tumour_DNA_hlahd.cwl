  # About this workflow
  This workflow runs fast HLA typing by restricting reads to those aligning with the HLA region prior to running HLA-HD.  
  Aligning the input FASTQs to a reference containing only the HLA region, then converting the mapped reads back to FASTQs allows us to restrict the reads used by HLA-HD to only those which are critically relevant to HLA typing. While it is optimal to provide all reads to HLA-HD, the runtime is prohibitively long. In our testing, this full read restriction method (including HLA-HD) has been shown to take approximately two thirds of the time taken to run HLA-HD alone on unrestricted reads.

  ## Before running this workflow
  Prior to running this workflow, you must create/download a Bowtie2 Index (generated using `bowtie2 build`) for a reference file **which only includes the HLA region on chromosome 6**. We recommend using the HLA region reference `hla_gen.fasta` provided by IMGT. It can be downloaded from the IMGT GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/ANHIG/IMGTHLA/tree/Latest/fasta) or using this download link [ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ipd/imgt/hla/hla_gen.fasta](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ipd/imgt/hla/hla_gen.fasta). The Bowtie2 Index files must then be archived using the `tar` command before being used as the Bowtie2 Index Archive input to this workflow.  
  **A Bowtie2 index archive for `hla_gen.fasta` can be downloaded from the disTIL repo to be used as an input for this workflow. The corresponding Bowtie2 Index Prefix parameter should be `hla_gen`.**

  ## Steps
  This workflow follows the steps recommended by the HLA-HD authors [here](https://www.genome.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/HLA-HD/) under the subheadings Tips > Filtering of reads (March 6, 2019).
  1. Use `bowtie2` to map the input paired-end FASTQs to the HLA reference sequence (provided as the Bowtie2 Index Archive).
  2. Use `samtools view` to extract mapped reads (using option `-F 4`).
  3. Use `samtools fastq` to convert the BAM of aligned HLA reads to paired-end FASTQs.
  4. Run HLA-HD using the new, smaller FASTQs (containing only those reads which aligned to the HLA region) as input.
