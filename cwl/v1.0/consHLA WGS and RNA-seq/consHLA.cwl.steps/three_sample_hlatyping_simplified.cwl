  # About this workflow
  This workflow runs HLA-HD (with restricted reads for speed) on three sets of paired-end FASTQs (tumour DNA, tumour RNA, and normal DNA) and generates a consensus type for each HLA allele.  See the `hlahd-consensus-parser` tool documentation for more information on how a consensus HLA type is determined.

  ## Outputs
  There are 4 main outputs from this tool:
  - **HLA Consensus JSON:** a JSON file containing consensus alleles for **all typed HLA genes at the highest possible accuracy level** (two- or three-field).
  - **HLA Consensus Text File:** a text file containing all **unique consensus alleles** from all HLA genes which were successfully typed by HLA-HD for which a consensus could be determined (i.e. 'Not typed' and 'No consensus' alleles are removed). The alleles are truncated to two-field accuracy. This file can be used as input to pVACtools.
  - **Clinically Significant HLA Consensus JSON:** a JSON file containing consensus alleles for **a subset of clinically significant HLA genes (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRA, -DRB1, -DRB3, -DRB4, -DRB5, -DQA1, -DQB1, -DPA1, -DPB1) at the highest possible accuracy level** (two- or three-field).
  - **Clinically Significant HLA Consensus Text File:** a text file containing all **unique consensus alleles** from the clinically significant subset of HLA genes(defined above) which were successfully typed by HLA-HD for which a consensus could be determined (i.e. 'Not typed' and 'No consensus' alleles are removed). The alleles are truncated to two-field accuracy. This file can be used as input to pVACtools.

  In addition, a JSON file is generated containing the two/three sets of input HLA-HD results in a format consistent with that of the consensus allele JSONs.
